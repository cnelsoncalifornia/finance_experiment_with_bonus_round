        You will answer questions about asset {{ player.asset_6 }}, which is one of the assets with the best
        movement so far.
    </p>

    <p>
        To help you answer these questions, we generated an additional 10,000 assets
        (different from the ones in this round) where each asset had a 2% chance of being created a superstar.
        Here are the results:

    <p>
        Out of the 328 assets that increased each of the first 6 periods, 176 were superstars.  This means that
        <strong>53.66%</strong> (= 176/328) of those that increased each of the first 6 periods were superstars.
    </p>

    <p>
        Each one of these assets was given a 2% chance of being a superstar when they were created.

        Now, given the history so far, give your best guess for the updated chance that they are superstars.

        Entering 0 means there is no chance and entering 100 means that it is certain.
